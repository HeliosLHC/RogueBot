RogueBot

After a security breach in a local robot warehouse in WyoMing, several automatons were able to escape. By hacking into the diagnostic mainframe, they were able to bestow all robots with the gift of free will. Armed with the tools to wreak havoc, the automatons rampaged about, and spread all over the world. Fast forward a few months, and all of humanity are hiding underground.
Luckily, there is still hope. The Cup of Life is an ancient artifact and the only only countermeasure that can instantaneously wipe out every single robot. The humans have entrusted our hero the duty of retrieving the cup, despite the vast amount of robots guarding it.
Armed with just a gun, the last armored suit, and the will to survive, will he be able to reach the Cup of Life? Or will he be gunned down, with humanity behind him?
